MultiDWTNet is a deep-learning project that implements **DWTNet**, a hybrid model tailored for dynamic-spectrum **denoising** and **radio-frequency interference (RFI) detection**. By seamlessly combining 2-D Discrete Wavelet Transforms (DWT/IDWT) with Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), DWTNet captures and reconstructs multi-scale features from timeâ€“frequency data with exceptional fidelity.

## Key Features

- **Hybrid Architecture**  
  Residual blocks + DWT/IDWT + DenseBlocks for powerful feature extraction and reconstruction.

- **Dual Outputs**  
  Simultaneously produces  
  1. Denoised dynamic spectra  
  2. RFI masks for anomaly detection.

- **Synthetic Data Engine**  
  Uses [**setigen**](https://setigen.readthedocs.io) to generate realistic dynamic spectra with controllable signals, noise, and RFIâ€”perfect for **radio astronomy** and **SETI**.

- **Flexible Training**  
  Adaptive loss functions, built-in checkpointing, and easy hyper-parameter tuning for long-running experiments.

## Model Architecture

| Component | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| **Encoder** | Residual blocks + DWT down-sampling (LP & HP coefficients). |
| **Bottleneck** | Depth-wise separable convolutions for deeper feature maps. |
| **Decoder (Dual-Branch)** | |
| &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Denoising Branch | IDWT + residual blocks â†’ clean spectrum. |
| &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;RFI Mask Branch | Dense blocks + up-sampling â†’ pixel-wise RFI mask. |

## Dataset

Synthetic dynamic spectra generated on-the-fly via the `setigen` library.  
Configure signals, background noise, and RFI patterns in `SETIdataset.py` (`DynamicSpectrumDataset` class).
